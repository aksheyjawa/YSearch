Use these commands
==================

npm run watch-css      -> For watching and building scss
npm run start          -> To start the server

start mongo
PORT=3002 node bin/www      -> start express server (in express directory)
								// Should be nodemon

Running both servers together
-----------------------------
Run servers for backend and frontend separately

Yarn (not being used)
=====================


yarn start
  Starts the development server.

yarn build
  Bundles the app into static files for production.

yarn test
  Starts the test runner.

yarn eject
  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:
  cd ysearchapp
  yarn start

Happy hacking!
